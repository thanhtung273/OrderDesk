// Cancellation rules for OrderDesk.
//
// An order may be cancelled while nothing has been dispatched. Once the first
// shipment leaves the warehouse the order can only be returned, not cancelled —
// the refusal message should guide the clerk toward that flow. An order with
// any recorded refund can no longer be cancelled either.
